## License NVA's and enable FGSP

1. Once the NVA's are deployed the next step is to license the NVA. Instructors will be licensing the NVA's from Fortimanager. The following command is reference only do not complete this as part of your lab. 

```exec vm-license <token>```

The NVA's will reboot. 

2. We need to enable FGSP on both FortiGate's since NVA's are depoyed in Active-Active setup and we need session sync. 

On FGT-A CLI, configure the peer IP in which this device will peer with.

{{% notice warning %}}Please copy this code blocks into notepad and edit the PeerIP address, remove the comment before you paste it on FortiGate{{% /notice %}} 

```
config system standalone-cluster
    config cluster-peer
        edit 1
            set peerip x.x.x.x (this will be the port2 Private IP address of peer FGT-B)
        next
    end
    set standalone-group-id 1
    set group-member-id 1
end
```

3. Once you paste the above content, you will see a prompt like below. select Y. 

    **vwanXX-sdfw-wdmc4mms~000 (standalone-cluster) # end**
    
    **Changing standalone-group-id or group-member-id will potentially affect FGSP traffic.**
    **Please first make sure the member is isolated from FGSP cluster properly.**
    **Do you want to continue? (y/n)y**

On FGT-B CLI, configure the peer IP in which this device will peer with:

```
config system standalone-cluster
    config cluster-peer
        edit 1
            set peerip x.x.x.x (this will be the port2 Private IP address of peer FGT-A)
        next
    end
    set standalone-group-id 1
    set group-member-id 2
end
```

4. You will see same prompt like Step 3. Select Y again.
